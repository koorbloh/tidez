# tidez

This is my Puget Sound Tidez App.

Unity project, I'm using Unity 5.6.1f1 and I have a hella pro license from work.

It pulls weather and tides from a couple NOAA REST API endpoints.  

It graphs the data, and it does it without any other buttons, ads, or any other bloat.

It was made by an engineer, for an engineer, to fit his phone.  

Download and install the APK if you want.

You're welcome to steal, clone, dupe, use as example code, whatever.  You can even send me pull requests, feedback, or whatever.

It's clearly not finished.  It likely won't ever be polished.  I'm cool with that.  It was mostly made to pass the time.
